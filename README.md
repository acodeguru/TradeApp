## Run TradeApp
npm start

## Please make sure to install modules
### This app will automatically synchronize the db tables as I haven't separated migration script from the source code. 


## Jenkins has been configured for this application, therefore, please remove the "image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY}:${BUILDVERSION}" line  from the docker composefile
